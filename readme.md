# Homework Planner Prototype
By Ethan and Mica - G11

## Description

This is a prototype project based on our idea for a homework planner.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Limitations

This project is limited to the following:
- There is no rewards page
- There is no persistant storage
- There is no user idenity and persistance

## AI

AI was used in this project in these cases:
- Generating Boilerplate Code
- Completing Syntax
- Generating Comments

AI was not used in this project in these cases:
- Generating Functionality Code
- Anything more complicated then boilerplate

The AI model(s) used: [ SuperMaven, Anthropic ]

These models where prompted (where applicable) to be helpful by indexing code,
and using that to pridict the next line of code. This prioritizes and limits
the AI model(s) to use code already present in the project rather then getting
it from other sources.
